# Best Practices for Identity Governance

## Introduction

The following reading outlines the recommended best practices for identity governance using Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). These recommendations are targeted toward using Azure AD as a centralized means for access and identity management of system entities. You will learn how to manage user access through solid identity management and the best practices for accessing company resources, whether it’s through an application or a device.

The reading will also explore several other safeguarding measures that are required for adopting a strong security posture, including using other Microsoft SaaS products such as Sentinel and Defender.

## Best Practices for Identity Governance

Best practices for identity governance play a crucial role in fortifying your organization’s security framework. These practices encompass various strategies and principles within Azure Active Directory (AD) that contribute to a robust identity management system.

### Identity Governance Interface

#### Service Principals

Service principals are crucial for your organization to secure access to external applications. Establishing a service principal involves assigning an identity to an application, thus enabling it to authenticate and access your resources using Azure AD. This allows it to manage the application and determine the scope of the application for accessing network resources.  
For example, if you want to expose specific databases to the customer for consumption, a solid service principal ensures that only the appropriate tables and data are accessed.

#### Managed Identities

Managed identities streamline and automate identity management, credentials, certificates, and keys for applications and services. By leveraging managed identities within Azure AD, you can eliminate the need for addressing these aspects individually. This approach reduces the management of credentials, decreasing the exposure that using these credentials creates.

### Identity as a Security Perimeter

In the context of Bring Your Own Device (BYOD), remote work, and cloud-based networks, adopting identity as a security perimeter is pivotal. It encourages centralized management through the implementation of Defense in Depth strategies in Azure Active Directory. These strategies include:

- Robust authentication methods
- Conditional access policies
- Network segmentation
- Zero Trust policies
- Auditing actions
- Applying identity protection

These measures not only thwart impersonation but also closely monitor user activities.

### Additional Strategies

Additional strategies ensure that company devices remain consistently patched and updated with security measures within Azure AD. Activation tools like Microsoft Defender and Azure Sentinel facilitate the analysis of user behavior for anomalies and scan for malware, bolstering your security posture within Azure AD.

### Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

Implementing MFA provides organizations with a resilient practice requiring users to authenticate through multiple methods before accessing sensitive data, effectively preventing unauthorized access.  
Best practices suggest:

- Coupling MFA with specific actions, such as altering configurations or requesting sensitive data
- Maintaining security through Azure Active Directory
- Using MFA frequently, especially for roles with elevated access levels
- Linking MFA with conditional access policies for robust defense against intrusion

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

Implementing RBAC in Azure AD ensures tasks align with designated roles, adhering to the principle of least privilege.  
Key points:

- Additional privileges require justification, a defined retention period, and notifications for transparency and oversight
- RBAC is a cornerstone of solid identity management in Azure AD

### Role Management

Role assignment management should always begin with templated roles provided by Azure Active Directory. These roles are tailored to specific tasks and lack excessive privileges, aligning with the principle of least privilege.  
When roles require variation, modifying existing roles is recommended for consistency and adherence to Azure AD best practices.  
Templated roles benefit from Microsoft's practices and are linked with the privilege of performing some actions, providing security and usability advantages.

### Group and Access Lifecycle

Assigning roles to groups streamlines centralized management for accessing project resources within Azure AD.  
Aligning the access lifecycle with project phases ensures privilege adjustments as needed, fostering efficient and secure resource utilization within Azure AD.

Incorporating the above approaches when using Azure AD and associated technologies enhances your identity management and security strategies, bolstering your organization's overall digital protection.

## Conclusion

The recommendations explored throughout this reading focused on using Azure AD to manage access and identities effectively.  
You learned that securing access to external apps through service principals simplifies identity management with managed identities and provides an organization with a layer of robust security.

It’s important to note that Azure AD serves as a control hub. It offers a range of access controls fortified with layered security methods, including:

- Robust authentication methods
- Policies for conditional access
- A cautious “trust no one” approach

Additionally, you can enhance real-time threat analysis and user behavior monitoring by integrating Sentinel and Defender.
