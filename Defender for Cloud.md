## Distinctions: Free Versus Advanced Tier

There is a significant difference between the free and advanced tiers of Defender. Enabling the upgrade provides the following extras:

- **Endpoint detection and response (EDR):** Real-time analysis and monitoring of endpoints (servers, devices, computers).
- **Vulnerability scanning for virtual machines:** Any virtual machine you spin up can be included in Defender’s umbrella of protection.
- **Multi-cloud security:** Defender can be extended to protect other cloud resources, such as Amazon Web Services. This cross-platform service mitigates vendor lock-in by facilitating integration with services from different providers.
- **Hybrid security:** Includes scanning of both on-premises and cloud-based resources.
- **Threat protection alerts:** Provides a suite of services to pre-emptively prevent breaches and respond during an active incursion, streamlining investigations and maintaining optimal security.
- **Compliance tracking:** Using the Azure Security Benchmark as the standard, Defender can monitor compliance with different regulatory and industry standards according to your organization's affiliation. This custom feature makes it easier to comply with various specialized laws.
- **Access and application controls:** Coupled with just-in-time (JIT) access policy, Defender can be tailored to block malware by enforcing specific access controls to network ports. This proactive measure reduces the risk of falling victim to common attacks like brute force network attacks.
